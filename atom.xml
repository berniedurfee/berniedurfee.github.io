    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>So here&rsquo;s the challenge&hellip;</p>

<p>I need to be able to mirror GitHub repositories between GitHub instances. Many repositories. So I want a little tool that will take a list of source and destination repositories (YAML?) and will automatically setup and maintain the mirrors.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to start with <a href="https://github.com/technicalpickles/jeweler">Jeweler</a>, which I hear is good&hellip;</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Oh it&rsquo;s been a while since I&rsquo;ve blogged at all. Been busy! Fun stuff mostly!</p>

<p>Anyway, I&rsquo;m back, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;ve missed me and I hope to have some fun with this blog.</p>

<p>So this blog will be mostly tech stuff, some creative stuff and some other random stuff.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m building this blog with Octopress. Which is cool. Cooler than Wordpress or most of the other presses. I like that it&rsquo;s static, that&rsquo;s cool. Because guess what, this text isn&rsquo;t going to change much, so why keep it in a database? A blog is static, otherwise it wouldn&rsquo;t really be a blog. So static makes sense. I like things that make sense.</p>

<p>I tried Middleman with the blogging extension, but it didn&rsquo;t work. Not on my Windows machine and not not on my Mac. I didn&rsquo;t want to spend time hacking it. I wanted to spend time writing paragraphs. So I bailed. Octopress had a couple hiccups, but it worked within a short amount of time, so it wins.</p>

<p>Working without a rich text editor is interesting. I really didn&rsquo;t use much of the rich text stuff anyway. How often do you use the little buttons vs just writing stuff. I&rsquo;m using a text editor (Sublime) because Sublime is cool. Let me figure out how to do a link, hang on&hellip; how&rsquo;s this <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime</a> is cool.</p>

<p>So like I said, I&rsquo;ll be blogging about tech stuff, mostly IT, because I work in IT now. I&rsquo;m trying to do &ldquo;real&rdquo; DevOps. It&rsquo;s not easy! I&rsquo;m doing more development work now, learning Ruby and Python, because they&rsquo;re cool.</p>

<p>The one thing about using a text editor is there&rsquo;s no spell checker, which is not cool. Hang on, maybe <a href="http://sublimetext.com/">Sublime</a> has one&hellip; eh, this is annoying. Package Control is not working, because I have it setup to use a proxy for work. But I&rsquo;m not at work, so no proxy and no Package Control. Unless I go disable the proxy, but that&rsquo;s a hassle. I&rsquo;ll open an issue with the Package Control team&hellip; I could just comment it out in the settings JSON, but JSON doesn&rsquo;t do comments. JSON doesn&rsquo;t do comments. Really.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the issue I opened: (<a href="https://github.com/wbond/sublime_package_control/issues/742">https://github.com/wbond/sublime_package_control/issues/742</a>)</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s enough for now. Welcome to the Tower of Prattle&hellip; stay with me!</p>
